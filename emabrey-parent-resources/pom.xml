		<!-- Resources provided for the standard-parent to use in other project modules via using a dependency on this
             artifact. Any plugin that supports classpath resources can be cleanly implemented via this process. This
             is superior because it avoids the problem of relative/absolute paths to certain classpath resources during
             any Maven build process covering multiple modules/POMs. Solving the pathing problem also solves another
             hard problem- making builds deterministic and repeatable.
